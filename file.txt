My family is a team! We are four in my family: my parents, my sister and me. We like to spend time together and play games.

My fatherâ€™s name is John. He has green eyes and brown hair. He is a football trainer and plays football every day with his pupils. Football is popular in England. My father is kind, strong and active.
